# CityFlow---Online-Bus-Ticket-Booking-Application

Major College Project | Full-Stack Development | Web & Android
<br>
Overview:
CityFlow is a complete online bus ticket booking system, built as both a web application and an Android app. The system streamlines the ticket booking process for users, enables admins to manage bus operations, and allows bus conductors to verify tickets efficiently.

Tech Stack:

Website: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Firebase Database

Android App: XML, Kotlin, Firebase Database

Key Features:

Admin Panel (Web): Secure login for admins to manage buses, routes, users, and booked tickets (Add/Edit/Delete/View).

User Functionality (Web & App): Users can search for buses, book tickets, and view booking history after logging in.

Bus Conductor App (Android): Conductors can log in to scan booked tickets for a specific bus, ensuring smooth verification.

This project demonstrates my skills in full-stack development, Firebase integration, and mobile & web application development.
